Split bill app in kotlin

The split app, developed in Kotlin, adopts a modular architecture to enhance maintainability and scalability. Leveraging Kotlin's expressive syntax, the application is divided into independent modules, each responsible for specific functionalities. This modular design facilitates code organization, promotes code reusability, and simplifies collaboration among development teams.

Key features include the incorporation of Kotlin's concise and expressive language features, such as null safety and extension functions, to enhance code robustness and readability. The split app employs Kotlin Coroutines for efficient and asynchronous programming, ensuring smooth and responsive user interactions.

The app's modular structure allows for the independent development and testing of each module, streamlining the debugging and maintenance processes. Additionally, the use of Kotlin's interoperability with existing Java code enables seamless integration with Android libraries and APIs.

Overall, this split app showcases the power of Kotlin in promoting modularization, code efficiency, and collaboration, making it a well-organized and maintainable solution for Android development
